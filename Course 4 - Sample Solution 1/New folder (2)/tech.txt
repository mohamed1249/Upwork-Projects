Teacher Feedback - Course 8:
Question 1: change values



Question 2: same formula but modify the final equation as to find the droplet diameter against the given velocity v



question 3: redraw the figure in part a shall be different and labelling style shall be different for each copy. for example for first copy label the low pressure high pressure low velocity high velocity etc. on figure for second right description below like this



For part b change the values in the file according to the due file of course 8 spring 2022
for part c the values are from part b but the rest is the same so just feeding values of part b will give a different part C



question 4: the values need to be changed but rest is the same



question 5 needs to be done again but the methodology will be same while the answers and graph might be different as the figure to solve is different the first part is the tricky one but rest are same with different values so can be done too
