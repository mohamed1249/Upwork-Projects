you want me in Q1 to :
1- Determine the most popular graduation faculties for students in the West. (analysis)
2- Determine if they are still sympathetic to the cause of giving and how many would be inclined to donate. (modeling)
Q2:
1- compare the donations received by faculty with the number of staff members in order to see the allocation of staff by faculty and determine if it made sense. (analysis)
2- what are the top cities to target top 5 ( analysis)
Q3:
1- which alumni were the most likely to make a donation (modeling)
2- at which level the most likely to make a donation (modeling)


Question 1



 Pelosi also knew there had been a huge oil boom in Western Canada in the past.
 There were additional questions about what Faculties should be going out there,
 whether or not they would even be able to reach those alumni after all these years,
 how many of them would be likely to make a gift.
 (Determine the most popular graduation faculties for students in the West.
 Determine if they are still sympathetic to the cause of giving and how many would be inclined to donate.)


Western Canada = British Columbia (BC), Alberta (AB), Saskatchewan (SK), Manitoba (MB)



Question 2



 All of these questions were put against the backdrop of maintaining a strong presence in Quebec,
 so she knew she could only target a few key regions. At the same time,
 she wondered whether the allocation of staff across the faculties made sense.
 (if you could compare the donations received by faculty with the number of staff members in order to see the allocation of staff by faculty and determine if it made sense.
 And also what are the top cities to target top 5)



Question 3



She wanted to know which alumni were the most likely to make a donation and at which level.
